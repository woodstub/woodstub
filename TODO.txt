Add support for custom excludes, to enable eg. LOG4J only to be loaded on the system class loader. right now log4j
also needs to be mocked to avoid spawning errors on the console

Stub class order is not interdependent, but could easily be done with some source analyzing before compiling and
injecting

Named parameters in addtion to indexed parameters for getting parameter values in StubCall (source is most likely 
available for stubs to be created)


30/7: Add support for enums! Right now we generate a class that extends Enum, which is not legal
